### Orientation and identity
longer story to explain, but, overall, i identify best with nonbinary, trans(feminine), and occasionally demigirl.

**i prefer people to use she/they pronouns**, thank you

note, those above dont picture it well that i am highly fluid with my attraction preferences and such over time.
To elaborate: it occurs that i loose complete interest of anything sexual or romantic.

Overall, id say that i am not interested in love matters and related, since it involves many adjustments in clear vision and adverse psychological effects.
for my preferences i do not care about bodyly matters alot, and im following the motto "mind over matter" which technically makes me pansexual, if you adhere to labels that hard.

And (explained further below), most of the shards are furry of varying degrees.


### Interests
this is a all-over-the-place topic but yea, if wikipedia would be a game, id have many hundreds of hours
lets split this into a few sections, or those above.


#### Gaming
i have a crippling gaming addiction . . .
(maaybe not crippling, but severe nonetheless) 
game genres that i enjoy are:

- On PC:
  - Minecraft
  - Factorio
  - basically any sandbox or factory game 
  - Mindustry
  - Hollow Knight
- On Mobile:
  - Eden
  - Keep Craft
  - Infinidode 2 
  - Sandship


#### Scientific Topics
topics that i enjoy browsing around and looking for on the interwebz are somewhat at home in heavy (metal-processing) industry and nuclear physics, but those are the most common since i find both quite interesting and both aesthetically pleasing.

otherwise, near-future science fiction concepts are also of value to me like bioscience, other propulsion methods and the use of particle physics in everyday life.


#### Music
well, this is a hard one, since my taste of music is similarly fluid like my identity. someone once said to me:

> express yourself using music [was clothing in that context] or find your identity to express using music

some keywords are according to spotify `Classic Rock - Space Ambient - Steampunk - New Wave Punk - Shanty`
just, look at contacts below for linkage



### My Dream Realm
Someday i started to write about characters that inherit parts of my personality, with the aim to effectively split myself into those characters. that didnt suceed but i kept to write still, and now i got a pretty intricate canon of characters and places in my head.
this went on and im somewhat doing self therapy with it by packing it all with hefty metaphors and details. its at a point where i almost dissociate into there when circumstances are correct.
No, these Characters do not posess indepencendce nor take control over any of my actions, i cancelled that development

#### Shards
Shards are the collective term for Characters that ive made so far, or rather, isolated from the rest of myself.
Currently, there are 7 Shards:
- Devin
  - A feline anthro(pomorph) who is a impure Vessel from Void, but addicted to cuddles and clingy
- Antares
  - A black-coloured Dragon who has changed their gender over their lifespan. their history is mostly unknown.
- Leonis
  - Resident of Dhat-Badan, a massive Tree similar to Yggdrasil, and owner of a internationally renown library. Tea enjoyer.
- Valerie
  - A girl whos heart had to be replaced with a mechanical variant, living in steampunk era. Well-Versed with mechanics and practical technology.
- Rastaban
  - A mechanical dragon orginally tasked to protect a kingdom, went rouge and now is a agressive and violent killer machine.
- Evelyn
  - Human female of unknown identity and age, well-experienced with clothes, but usually keeps a depressive mindset.
- Ray
  - Formerly Human whos now a Cyborg being, traumatised by forced experiences in sex work.
