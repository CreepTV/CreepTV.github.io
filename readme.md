(Disclaimer: topic separation is not really enforced hard so eh)
### Orientation and identity
longer story to explain, but, overall, i identify best with nonbinary, trans(feminine), and occasionally demigirl.

**i prefer people to use they/them pronouns**, thank you
(she/they is fine too but currently nah)

note, those above dont picture it well that i am highly fluid with my attraction preferences and such over time.
To elaborate: it occurs that i loose complete interest of anything sexual or romantic.

Overall, id say that i am not interested in love matters and related, since it involves many adjustments in clear vision and adverse psychological effects. -> relevant issues
for my preferences i do not care about bodyly matters alot, and im following the motto "mind over matter" which technically makes me pansexual, if you adhere to labels that hard.

And (explained further below), most of the shards are furry of varying degrees.


### Interests
this is a all-over-the-place topic but yea, if wikipedia would be a game, id have many hundreds of hours
lets split this into a few sections, or those above.


#### Gaming
i have a crippling gaming addiction . . .
(maaybe not crippling, but severe nonetheless) 
game genres that i enjoy are:

- On PC:
  - Minecraft
  - Factorio
  - basically any sandbox or factory game 
  - Mindustry
  - Hollow Knight
- On Mobile:
  - Eden
  - Keep Craft
  - Infinidode 2 
  - Sandship


#### Scientific Topics
topics that i enjoy browsing around and looking for on the interwebz are somewhat at home in heavy (metal-processing) industry and nuclear physics, but those are the most common since i find both quite interesting and both aesthetically pleasing.
recently ive discovered geology or mineralogy for me because im working on a MC mod that features them, and theyre quite pretty too.

otherwise, near-future science fiction concepts are also of value to me like bioscience, other propulsion methods and the use of particle physics in everyday life.


#### Music
well, this is a hard one, since my taste of music is similarly fluid like my identity. someone once said to me:

> express yourself using music [was clothing in that context] or find your identity to express using music

some keywords are according to spotify `Classic Rock - Space Ambient - Steampunk - New Wave Punk - Shanty`
just, look at contacts below for linkage



### My Dream Realm
Someday i started to write about characters that inherit parts of my personality, with the aim to effectively split myself into those characters. that didnt suceed but i kept to write still, and now i got a pretty intricate canon of characters and places in my head.
this went on and im somewhat doing self therapy with it by packing it all with hefty metaphors and details. its at a point where i almost dissociate into there when circumstances are correct.
No, these Characters do not posess indepencendce nor take control over any of my actions, i cancelled that development
but i think that it would be possible to access the assoicated traits by calling me by the name of that shard. 

#### Shards
Shards are the collective term for Characters that ive made so far, or rather, isolated from the rest of myself.
Currently, there are 8 Shards:
- Devin
  - A feline anthro(pomorph) who is a impure Vessel from Void, but addicted to cuddles and clingy.
- Antares
  - A black-coloured Dragon who has changed their gender over their lifespan. their history is mostly unknown.
- Leonis
  - Resident of Dhat-Badan, a massive Tree similar to Yggdrasil, and owner of a internationally renown library, therefore jack-of-all-trades. Tea enjoyer. 
- Valerie
  - A girl whos heart had to be replaced with a mechanical variant, living in steampunk era. Well-Versed with mechanics and practical technology.
- Rastaban
  - A mechanical dragon orginally tasked to protect a kingdom, went rouge and now is a agressive and violent killer machine.
- Evelyn
  - Human female of unknown identity and age, well-experienced with clothes, but is acutely affected by a severe depression and self harm.
- Ray
  - Formerly Human whos now a Cyborg being, traumatised by forced experiences in sex work.
- Carla
  - A memetic concept of a hummingbird, who only appears in dreams and is renown for being annoying and unnerving.

#### Places 
this is a long list, since each area or place is highly detailed with many special ideas and such, including transition zones and climate,
but heres a short rundown:

- Green Swale of the Seven Spires
Residence of Devin and Leonis on Dhat-Badan, is a thick and lush jungle, with many rivers.
- Astral Ocean
A vast ocean that spans the coast of the northern reaches and swale. residence to Antares. the sky here is always clear to stars and more.
- Nothern Reaches 
Afoot of a mountain massive lays a ice flat, where the metaphoric emotional cold resides.

those are the "main" places as of right now, not going to go into detail that much.

### Noteworthy issues

 those are listed here, but i will not (for my own privacy or secrecy, whatever) tell where i got those from.
 
 i am currently in a psychological clinic for a various span of reasons, but im getting quite well along with them, usually.

ive been branded/diagnosed with Aspergs autism of a low degree, which makes me (un)able to:
 - handle emotions (express, sense, interpret) well (also affected by other things)
 - hyperfixate on certain topics (those above) 
 - some others i forget at times

original reason for said clinic visit is a mild to severe depression, which im fighting actively now and geting along comparedly well.
from then, it got discovered that i sorta have a bonding trauma, which affects my social ways of doing things. to elavorate, its hard for me to find and/or stay with new people, fear of loosing someone and "not really bringing yourself into a relation". 

identity and sexuality struggles are on the list too, but i think that transfem wraps those up relatively well.

i have a problem with limits, meaning that i cant really defend myself if someone passes my no-go-zone nor do i properly sense the boundaries of others.
usually, asking fixes this, but social issues, aaaa, it all loops, ffs
(this sorta means that i/central me wouldnt feel harmed or such if you talk over otherwise sensitive topics such as sexuality, intimate topics or else.)

**if youre uncertain about anything, go ahead, ask me**
